### CodeBook ###
This exercise is for the final exercise for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

The data in the project comes from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The major datafiles are two more or less equal test and train dataset, containing:
  - subject_test.txt (2947 observations of 1 variables)
  - X_test.txt (2947 observations of 561 variables)
  - y_test.txt (2947 observations of 1 variables)
  
  -subject_train.txt (7352 obs of 1 variables)
  - X_train.txt (7352 observations of 561 variables)
  - y_train.txt (7352 observations of 1 variables)
  
 Furthermore, it contains the:
  - activity_labels.txt: describing the activity name corresponding with the activity code (6 observations of 2 variables)
  - features; containing the variables names (561 observations of 2 variables)
  
  - features_info; describing more the reasoning behind the features name
  
 Finally, there is the ReadMe.txt file explaining the data and research purpose of data 
 

### Data Modification ###
 
After the first modifications the Complete_table variable is created by combining all datasets together, containing 10299 observations of 563 variables
The answer to question 4 is created by the next modifications resulting in the Total_Set_With_Activity_Label, containing 10299 observations of 10 variables
Finally, for question 5 a new data set is created, called: New_data_set_sorted containing 180 observations of 10 variables.
